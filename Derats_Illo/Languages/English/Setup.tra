Level: 9
Range: Touch 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negate

When the Imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the vistime is entombed in a state of suspended animation in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell—Freedom—is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists; rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then <PRO_HESHE> will reappear exactly where <PRO_HESHE> was last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner and she can only protect herself from this spell by succeeding at a saving throw against spells at -4~
