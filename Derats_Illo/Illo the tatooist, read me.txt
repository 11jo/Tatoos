Illo sells tattoos.
You'll find him in BG2 outside the thieves' guild, to the south under the shady courtyard.
You'll find him in Black Pits 2, away from the merchants' circle.
You'll find it in IWDEE, next to Coulon's forge in Kuldahar.

These tattoos are for single use only and are used like a tome: one tattoo = one ability or power.

They're expensive, but they're powerful. I know you like this.

An optional component halves the price to make them more affordables.

A second optional component (for IWDEE only) reduces tattoo prices by a further 20% (because the economy of IWDEE is not the same as that of BG2EE).
