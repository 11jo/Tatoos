Illo sells tattoos.
You'll find him in BG2 in the thieves' hideout, in the shadows in the same room as the black market vendor.
You'll find him in Black Pits 2, away from the merchants' circle.
You'll find it in IWDEE, next to Coulon's forge in Kuldahar.

These tattoos are for single use only and are used like a tome: one tattoo = one ability or power.

They're expensive, but they're powerful. I know you like them.
